# transit_and_pandemic
This repository contains the sql code for analyzing the effect of the pandemic on transit use in NYC.

In this project I examined the short and long term effects of the pandemic on NYC transit. Major findings include that buses and subways are still at less than 70% of pre-pandemic ridership, and that wealthy areas of the city decreased their ridership more than lower income areas.

Data cleaned and analyzed using mySQL and presented using Tableau. Sourced from NYC open data.
